# Todo:

- Test cases
    - most of these are done
- Step for provisioning the USB with the noble/oracular image
- Shut off machine (from zapper, we don't want to do that from the actual DUT, that'll be a nightmare) - maybe we can do it via ssh to the DUT? but that sucks butts
- get through bios and boot into installer with robot framework - or whatever
